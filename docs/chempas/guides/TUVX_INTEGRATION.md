# TUV-x Integration Summary

This note summarizes the CheMPAS-A TUV-x integration work completed to date and
records the development test case used to validate it. It is intended as the
stable overview document for TUV-x work; detailed implementation planning lives
in `docs/chempas/plans/2026-03-06-tuvx-photolysis-integration.md`, and recorded run
results live in `docs/chempas/results/TEST_RUNS.md`.

## Scope

CheMPAS-A uses TUV-x to compute photolysis rates for idealized chemistry
mechanisms, including `jNO2` for the supercell LNOx-O3 case and the Chapman
rates (`jO2`, `jO3_O`, `jO3_O1D`, `jNO2`) for Chapman + NOx. The integration
was developed in phases:

1. Phase 0: fixed-rate LNOx-O3 chemistry and lightning-NOx source
2. Phase 1: solar-zenith-angle fallback photolysis
3. Phase 2: clear-sky TUV-x photolysis from host atmospheric profiles
4. Phase 3: cloud attenuation in TUV-x using host `qc` and `qr`

The current implementation target beyond this summary is later Phase 3
hardening and follow-on photolysis realism, not the original Phase 1-2 bring-up.

## Implementation Summary By Phase

### Phase 0: LNOx-O3 prerequisite

Purpose:
- replace the initial ABBA-only coupling exercise with a scientifically
  meaningful tropospheric NO-NO2-O3 cycle
- establish the operator-split lightning source path before adding TUV-x

Delivered:
- `NO + O3 -> NO2 + O2`
- `NO2 + hv -> NO + O3`
- lightning NO source controlled by updraft threshold, reference velocity, and
  altitude window
- optional sink path via separate MICM config

Outcome:
- stable supercell runs
- correct O3 titration in the storm core
- exact Ox conservation in the controlled no-source/no-transport diagnostic

### Phase 1: fallback solar geometry

Purpose:
- validate photolysis-time dependence before introducing radiative transfer

Delivered:
- Spencer-style solar geometry helper in `mpas_solar_geometry.F`
- `jNO2 = j_max * max(0, cos_sza)` fallback path
- `j_jNO2` diagnostic output in MPAS history files

Outcome:
- daytime `j_jNO2` scaled exactly with `cos_sza`
- nighttime `j_jNO2` went to zero
- fallback path remained available when `config_tuvx_config_file = ''`

### Phase 2: clear-sky TUV-x

Purpose:
- replace scalar `jNO2` with column-dependent clear-sky photolysis computed
  from host atmospheric profiles

Delivered:
- `config_tuvx_config_file` namelist switch
- TUV-x module initialization and per-column execution
- extraction of height, density, temperature, water vapor, and ozone from MPAS
- `jNO2(level, cell)` write-back into MICM rate parameters

Outcome:
- physically plausible clear-sky vertical structure
- surface `j_jNO2` in the expected order of magnitude
- stable 15-minute idealized supercell chemistry runs

### Phase 3: cloud attenuation

Purpose:
- let TUV-x respond to storm cloud structure rather than treating all columns
  as clear-sky

Delivered:
- host-driven cloud radiator in TUV-x
- cloud optical depth derived from Kessler `qc` and `qr`
- cloud-aware `j_jNO2` attenuation and above-cloud enhancement

Outcome:
- strong `j_jNO2` suppression inside cloudy columns
- clear-sky columns preserved Phase 2 behavior
- above-cloud enhancement consistent with cloud albedo feedback

## Development Test Case

The TUV-x development case is the idealized supercell already used for the
LNOx-O3 chemistry work. The values below describe the historical phase-gate
runs recorded in `docs/chempas/results/TEST_RUNS.md`; the tracked
`test_cases/supercell/namelist.atmosphere` template currently defaults to a
2-hour midnight run and carries the LNOx/TUV-x and Chapman blocks as commented
examples to enable per-case editing.

### Location and runtime

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Run directory | `~/Data/CheMPAS/supercell` |
| Grid / case | Idealized supercell, 60 stretched levels (0–50 km) |
| Phase-gate start time | `0000-01-01_18:00:00` |
| Phase-gate run duration | `00:30:00` for Phase 1, `00:15:00` for Phase 2/3 comparisons |
| Dynamics timestep | `3.0 s` |
| MPI layout | `mpiexec -n 8` |
| Decomposition prefix | `supercell.graph.info.part.` |
| Coordinates used for fallback SZA | `35.86 N`, `97.93 W` (Kingfisher, Oklahoma) |
| Physics suite | `none` |
| Microphysics | `mp_kessler` |

### Chemistry configuration

The commented LNOx/TUV-x block in
`test_cases/supercell/namelist.atmosphere` uses these settings:

| Namelist option | Value | Meaning |
|-----------------|-------|---------|
| `config_micm_file` | `lnox_o3.yaml` | Tropospheric development mechanism |
| `config_lnox_source_rate` | `0.5` | NO source in `ppbv/s` when `w - w_threshold = w_ref` |
| `config_lnox_w_threshold` | `5.0` | Updraft threshold in `m/s` |
| `config_lnox_w_ref` | `10.0` | Excess updraft used for source scaling |
| `config_lnox_z_min` | `5000.0` | Minimum source altitude in `m` |
| `config_lnox_z_max` | `12000.0` | Maximum source altitude in `m` |
| `config_j_no2_max` | `0.01` | Phase 1 daytime `j_max` in `s^-1` |
| `config_lnox_nox_tau` | `0.0` | Sink disabled |
| `config_chemistry_latitude` | `35.86` | Fallback SZA latitude |
| `config_chemistry_longitude` | `-97.93` | Fallback SZA longitude |
| `config_tuvx_config_file` | `tuvx_no2.json` | Enable TUV-x for Phase 2/3 |

Additional setup used during development:

- initialize `qO3 = 50 ppbv`, `qNO = 0`, `qNO2 = 0` with
  `scripts/init_lnox_o3.py`
- copy `lnox_o3.yaml` and, for Phase 2/3, `tuvx_no2.json` into the run
  directory
- use `io_type="netcdf"` in `streams.atmosphere` on the macOS/LLVM build path

Why the synthetic start time:
- Phase 1 used a fixed daytime UTC that gives daylight at the Kingfisher test
  coordinates without requiring grid coordinates in the chemistry path
- the DC3-specific timestamp remains later validation work once grid-aware
  coordinates are available in the workflow

## Recorded Development Results

### Phase 1

- `cos_sza = 0.508` at `18:00 UTC`
- `cos_sza = 0.516` by `18:30 UTC`
- `j_jNO2 = 0.00508 -> 0.00516 s^-1`
- midnight test produced `j_jNO2 = 0`

### Phase 2

- surface `j_jNO2 = 7.2e-3 s^-1`
- top-of-domain `j_jNO2 = 1.2e-2 s^-1`
- `NO` peak `29.9 ppbv`
- `NO2` peak `6.5 ppbv`
- `O3` minimum `43.5 ppbv`
- empty `config_tuvx_config_file` correctly fell back to Phase 1 behavior

### Phase 3

- cloud develops after about 5 minutes in the supercell
- `346` cloudy columns and `27,734` clear columns at `t = 15 min`
- cloudy minimum `j_jNO2 = 6.27e-5 s^-1`
- clear-sky surface `j_jNO2 = 7.16e-3 s^-1`
- above-cloud `j_jNO2` reaches about `1.5e-2 s^-1`
- `NO2` remains higher in cloudy columns where photolysis recycling is reduced

`docs/chempas/results/TEST_RUNS.md`.

## Multi-Photolysis Plumbing

CheMPAS-A couples TUV-x to MICM through a single-name convention: for every
photolysis reaction, the same string is used in four places —

```
<rxn_name>  == TUV-x JSON "name:" field
            == MICM yaml reaction "name:" field
            == runtime diagnostic variable "j_<rxn_name>"
            == MICM rate parameter key "PHOTO.<rxn_name>"
```

At chemistry init, `tuvx_init` enumerates every photolysis reaction the
TUV-x config registers and caches names + indices. The chemistry driver
then calls `musica_cache_photo_indices(names)` so MICM looks up
`PHOTO.<name>` for each one. The core interface injects matching
`j_<name>` diagnostics into the diag pool at runtime. At each step,
`tuvx_compute_photolysis` fills a `(n_rates, nVertLevels)` slab per cell,
and a single call to `musica_set_photolysis_rates` writes the full
`(n_rates, nVertLevels, nCells)` array into both the coupled and reference
MICM states.

The `j_<rate>` diagnostics are injected at runtime from the active TUV-x
mechanism's rate names (or `j_jNO2` for the `cos(SZA)` fallback when
`config_j_no2_max > 0`) — they are not build-time Registry variables. To have
them written to history, list the exact `j_<rate>` field names (e.g. `j_jNO2`)
in `stream_list.atmosphere.output`. They only exist when chemistry with
photolysis is configured, so remove any `j_<rate>` entries when running without
chemistry to avoid stream-manager warnings.

### Supported mechanisms (in `micm_configs/`)

| MICM yaml | TUV-x JSON | Rates | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|-------|---------|
| `lnox_o3.yaml` | `tuvx_no2.json` | jNO2 | Tropospheric LNOx-O3 development |
| `chapman_full.yaml` | `tuvx_chapman.json` | jO2, jO3_O, jO3_O1D | Stratospheric Chapman cycle |
| `chapman_nox.yaml` | `tuvx_chapman_nox.json` | jO2, jO3_O, jO3_O1D, jNO2 | Chapman + NOx catalytic O3 destruction |

Pick a paired MICM/TUV-x config via `&chemistry` and `&photolysis` in
`namelist.atmosphere`:

```
&chemistry
    config_micm_file = 'chapman_full.yaml'
/

&photolysis
    config_tuvx_config_file = 'tuvx_chapman.json'
    config_tuvx_top_extension = .true.
    config_tuvx_upper_column_mode = 'legacy_static'
    config_tuvx_extension_file = 'tuvx_upper_atm.csv'
    config_chemistry_latitude = 35.86
    config_chemistry_longitude = -97.93
/
```

Chapman and Chapman+NOx runs require realistic initial O3 (AFGL
mid-latitude-summer) — seed with `scripts/init_chapman.py`, optionally
`--seed-nox` for the NOx setup.

The Phase-1 `cos(SZA)` fallback is still available: when
`config_tuvx_config_file` is empty, chemistry runs with a single
synthesised `jNO2` rate equal to `config_j_no2_max * max(0, cos_sza)`.
The fallback is single-rate only; Chapman and Chapman+NOx mechanisms
require TUV-x.

### Per-cell solar geometry

By default chemistry uses the namelist scalars
`config_chemistry_latitude` / `config_chemistry_longitude` to compute a
single `cos_sza` shared by every column — appropriate for idealized
Cartesian-plane test cases (supercell, mountain wave, baroclinic wave).
For real spherical-mesh runs, set `config_chemistry_use_grid_coords =
.true.` in the `&photolysis` namelist; chemistry will then read `latCell`
and `lonCell` from the mesh and compute `cos_sza` per cell. The
per-cell path is used by both the TUV-x photolysis call and the
fallback `cos(SZA)` `j_NO2` rate. Default is `.false.` to preserve
exact bit-reproducibility of all idealized cases.

### TUV-x update interval

By default chemistry calls TUV-x every dynamics step. For long
integrations or fine `dt` values, this is more often than necessary —
photolysis rates evolve on minute-to-hour timescales, while the
dynamics `dt` may be a few seconds. Set
`config_tuvx_update_interval` (real, simulated seconds) in the
`&photolysis` namelist to throttle TUV-x to a coarser cadence. When the
configured interval has not yet elapsed since the last update,
`chemistry_step` skips the entire photolysis block; MICM keeps using
the rate parameters last set, and the `j_<rxn>` diagnostic fields
keep their last-written values. Default is `0.0` (update every step)
to preserve exact bit-reproducibility of all existing runs.

Typical operational values: 60 s for short-duration / fine-`dt`
idealized cases; several minutes for global production runs. A 60 s
interval at `dt = 3 s` runs TUV-x once every 20 chemistry steps.

## Column Extension Above MPAS Top

TUV-x can see a prescribed column above the MPAS domain so UV attenuation by
above-domain air and O3 is captured. Select the legacy static profile with:

```
config_tuvx_top_extension  = .true.
config_tuvx_upper_column_mode = 'legacy_static'
config_tuvx_extension_file = 'tuvx_upper_atm.csv'
```

The CSV file lives in the run directory. Format (one edge per row, bottom-up):

```
z_km,T_K,n_air_molec_cm3,n_O3_molec_cm3
50.00,270.65,2.13e16,6.45e11
55.00,260.77,1.18e16,2.02e11
...
100.00,195.08,1.19e13,2.85e07
```

The shipped default (`micm_configs/tuvx_upper_atm.csv`) covers 50–100 km at
5-km spacing (10 layers) using US Standard Atmosphere 1976 for T and air
density, and AFGL mid-latitude-summer O3. Regenerate with
`scripts/gen_tuvx_upper_atm.py`.

At init, TUV-x is built on `nVertLevels + n_ext_layers` grid sections
(70 for the default supercell setup). During each photolysis call the
per-column profile is stitched:

- MPAS layers 1..nVertLevels: from host state (rho, T, qO3).
- Extension layers nVertLevels+1..nVertLevels+n_ext: midpoint values
  averaged from CSV edges.
- Edge values are the usual neighbour-averages; the MPAS/extension join
  edge averages the top MPAS midpoint with the first extension midpoint.
- Cloud OD is zero in the extension.

Extension-layer `j` values are computed by TUV-x but discarded — only the
first `nVertLevels` slice flows back to MICM.

The extension CSV must start at the MPAS top (zero gap). For the 50-km
supercell this means `z_km = 50.0` is the first CSV row.

For a global spatial monthly O3 climatology, use:

```
config_tuvx_top_extension = .true.
config_tuvx_upper_column_mode = 'spatial_climatology'
config_tuvx_prescribed_field_file = 'merra2-o3-monthly-climatology.x1.40962.nc'
```

The NetCDF package must use `chempas-prescribed-field-package-v1`, contain the
exact MPAS cell IDs and geometry, and declare Gregorian monthly climatology
bounds. CheMPAS-A reads only rank-owned cells, caches the two active monthly
slabs, wraps December to January, and uses the actual runtime Gregorian month
lengths. The package begins at the model top and stores layer-mean O3 density
and independently checkable layer columns. Configuration or data errors are
fatal; the spatial mode never falls back to the CSV.

## Current Limits And Follow-On Work

- **No cloud shadows.** TUV-x runs as independent 1D columns (plane-parallel).
  At SZA ~59° the `j_jNO2` cross-section shows purely vertical structure — a
  cloud attenuates photolysis directly below it but has zero effect on
  neighboring columns. In reality the solar beam enters at an angle, so clouds
  should cast shadows to one side, reducing photolysis in adjacent clear-sky
  columns. A slant-column approximation (trace the beam through neighboring
  columns at the geometric SZA, accumulate their cloud OD as above-column
  attenuation) would capture the dominant effect without full 3D radiative
  transfer.
- the LNOx-O3 supercell remains the primary development case; Chapman and
  Chapman + NOx use the same multi-rate plumbing but still need their own
  MPAS-coupled validation plots
- aerosols, earth-sun-distance refinement, and ice hydrometeors are later work
- clear-sky/cloudy column split optimization is deferred
- some extended gate checks remain future work, including longer transition
  tests and MPI decomposition comparison
